# Voice-Assistant
The wit-version.py is the main program file for now...

it is highly recomended to install the same version of pyaudio wheel file as provided in the repository.....for that open the readmefile and modify the address path of the line containg the pyaudio to where you are going to place the downloaded pyaudio file.

Please note that I have added a feature that lets you manually put the mic on mute by pressing spacebar,leftarrow,rightarrow,1 or 2(you can modify it later to have only one key if you want to)

But be aware that once the mic is manually muted using the program you have to press on any of the keys mentioned above to unmute the mic.....i have integrated this feature to give the added advantage to force stop the speechrecognition from keeping listening even after you have spoken.
